This is a simple Perl program that prints the string "Hello World" to the screen. Here's how you can convert it to Python:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Print function
print("Hello World")
```
Note that in Python, we use the `print()` function instead of `print` as in Perl. Also, in Python, the `#! /usr/bin/perl` shebang line is not necessary, since Python can be run directly by calling its interpreter.
