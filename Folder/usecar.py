Here is the equivalent Python code:
```
# Import the necessary modules
from strict import *
from warnings import *
from car import *

# Create a new instance of the Car class
car = Car(brand="Toyota", model="Corolla")

# Print the brand and model
print("Brand: " + str(car.get_brand()))
print("Model: " + str(car.get_model()))

# Update the brand and model of the car
car.set_brand("Honda")
car.set_model("Civic")

# Print the updated brand and model
print("Updated Brand: " + str(car.get_brand()))
print("Updated Model: " + str(car.get_model()))
```
Note that in Python, we use `str()` to convert an object to a string, as in the line `print("Brand: " + str(car.get_brand()))`. Also note that in Python, we can directly print strings without concatenating them using `+` operator like in Perl.
