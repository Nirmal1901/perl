Here's the equivalent Python code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Import modules
import warnings
import sys

# Print function
print("Hello World")
```
Note that in Python, we use the `print()` function to output text to the console. The `#!` line is a shebang line that specifies the interpreter used to run the script (in this case, Python). The `import` statements import the necessary modules, and the `warnings` module is not necessary in this case, so it's commented out.
