Here is the Python code to convert the Perl code:
```
# import the necessary modules
from strict import Strict
from warnings import Warnings
from car import Car

# create a new instance of the Car class
car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")

# print the brand and model of the car
print("Brand:", car.get_brand())
print("Model:", car.get_model())

# set the brand and model of the car to "Honda" and "Civic", respectively
car.set_brand("Honda")
car.set_model("Civic")

# print the updated brand and model of the car
print("Updated Brand:", car.get_brand())
print("Updated Model:", car.get_model())
```
Note that in Python, the `use` statement is not necessary, as it is assumed by default that all modules are imported at the beginning of a script. Additionally, in Python, there is no need to declare variables using the `$` symbol, as this is not needed. Instead, you can simply assign values to variables directly, as shown in the converted code above.
