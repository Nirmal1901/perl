Here is the Python code that corresponds to the given Perl code:
```
class Car(object):
  def __init__(self, brand=None, model=None):
    self.brand = brand or "Unknown"
    self.model = model or "Unknown"
  
  @staticmethod
  def set_brand(self, brand):
    self.brand = brand
  
  @staticmethod
  def get_brand(self):
    return self.brand
  
  @staticmethod
  def set_model(self, model):
    self.model = model
  
  @staticmethod
  def get_model(self):
    return self.model
```
Note that in Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword, and methods are defined inside the class using the `@staticmethod` decorator. Additionally, Python does not have a concept of package-level methods like Perl does, so the `new` method is not necessary in Python.
